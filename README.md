BungeeJoin
==========

A super simple plugin that can run a configurable BungeeCord proxy-side command on the player's behalf when a user joins, as requested [here](http://www.spigotmc.org/threads/plugin-request-execute-command-on-join.18574).

The plugin will automatically create a config.yml, which can be edited to run any BungeeCord command, and then reloaded with the proxy-side command `reloadjoin` (permission `bungeejoin.reload`).
